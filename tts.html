            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <section>
                <p> Speech synthesis, also known as text-to-speech (TTS), has attracted increasingly more
                    attention in recent times. Recent advances on speech synthesis has shown that TTS systems
                    can produce very natural sounding speech from text. All around the world, TTS systems are
                    built using various approaches. In India speech research community has grown significantly
                    in the present time, and one can witness the current speech revolution. It is necessary to
                    understand and compare the various research techniques used to build Indian Language TTS
                    systems. Primary objective of this challenge is -- understanding and comparing the various
                    approaches to build TTS and simultaneously identifying efficient speech groups in the
                    country.
                    <br>
                    Good quality studio recorded speech data with very accurate transcript is required to build
                    a high quality TTS system. However, when it comes to Indian languages, not everyone,
                    especially academic institutions and startups, have access to these resources. As a part of
                    this challenge, we will be releasing good quality training data for Hindi and Tamil.
                    Everyone who participates in this challenge will then be free to use this data for research
                    purposes.
                </p>
            </section>

            <h3>Tasks</h3>
            <section>
                <p>About 5 hours of speech data in each of Hindi Male, Hindi Female, Tamil Male and Tamil
                    Female, recorded by native professional speakers in high quality studio environments,
                    and corresponding Text in UTF-8 format will be provided. No other information, such as
                    segment labels, will be provided. Participants may build one voice for one or more
                    subtask and submit for evaluation in web API form (as mentioned below). The subtasks are
                    numbered as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2020-ILTTS Hindi Male</li>
                    <li>2020-ILTTS Hindi Female</li>
                    <li>2020-ILTTS Tamil Male</li>
                    <li>2020-ILTTS Tamil Female</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <h3>Output Submission</h3>
            <section>
                <p>After building a system participants will have to put it on server and provide us url of GUI,
                    where text can be synthesised. Organisers will use this url to prepare test data for
                    listening test. This url may be public or private (only access to organiser).
                    It is not permissible for a single participant to submit multiple entries to any subtask
                    (mentioned above), because the listening test may otherwise become unmanageable. This rule
                    may be relaxed in the event of a small number of participants.</p>

                <h4>Write Up</h4>
                <p>Along with the built system participant will have to submit a write up (one page or two page)
                    about the entry mentioning approach, technology, data, challenge faced, features,
                    observations, etc.</p>
            </section>

            <h3>Evaluation Process</h3>
            <section>
                <h6>Listening Test</h6>
                <p>The organisers will conduct a DMOS (“degradation” or “differential” MOS test ) listening test
                    to evaluate the submitted system.</p>

            </section>

            <h3>Benefits of Participation</h3>
